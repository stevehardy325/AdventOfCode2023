[Advent Of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023) solutions for personal use

Contains a stub script directory meant to be copied and extended for each day. The stub directory includes:
  - `run.py` python script, meant to be edited for each day's specific needs
  - `test.txt` input file for test example
  - `input.txt` input file for user-specific input ("get your puzzle input")

Running `create_env.sh` or `create_env.ps1` will copy the stub directory to a new directory named for the current 2-digit day ("07" etc) so that each day can have it's own solution and inputs located in one place.
